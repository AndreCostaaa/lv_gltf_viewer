# `lv_gltf_viewer`

A simple glTF file viewer, made using the LVGL `3dtexture` widget.

Ensure [GLFW is installed](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/details/integration/driver/opengles.html) for this example.

## Getting Started

```shell
git clone <TODO>
git submodule update --init
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
./build/gltf_view -in ./gltfs/logo1.glb
```

---

The STB Image library is included temporarily, just copied from the latest build.  Ultimately it should probably be added as a git submodule, but it seems like that will add a few other things that aren't necessary so I'd like to look into a more minimal install for that.

---

To make this the default gltf / glb file viewer on your Raspberry Pi, you can do the following:

(from the root directory of this project)
```bash
cp ./EXAMPLE_gltf-view.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/gltf-view.desktop
xdg-mime default gltf-view.desktop model/gltf-binary
xdg-mime default gltf-view.desktop model/gltf-json
```

Now when you double click a gltf file in your file-manager, it should open glTF-View.

You can confirm the mime-types are setup correctly by viewing 
```
~/.config/mimeapps.list
```
